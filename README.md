# Set Up 

## Setting up the Database
To set up our database, we used MySQL Workbench. We created a new schema called 'bygdb' and by running the SQL script located at `/data/createDatabase.sql`. This creates all necessary tables.

To populate them with initial data, run the SQL script located at `/data/updateDatabase.sql`. This will insert sample data into the tables. This file can be modified to create new users. Users, accounts and portfolios ids are created via sql scripts - creation is not yet supported by the frontend.

## Running server
```bash
cd server
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir
python app.py
```

## Running client
After running the server, open ``localhost:5000`` in your browser.

## Dumping the database to a file
Run this command on bash:
```bash
& "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqldump.exe" -u root -p bygDB > latest_dump.sql

```

## The Portfolio 

![Portfolio Dashboard](screenshots/portfolio.jpeg)

This page provides a comprehensive view of a user's **equity portfolio**.  
It lists all stocks currently held, their performance, transaction history, and sector allocation.  
The dashboard is designed to help users track **portfolio value**, **daily changes**, and **cumulative returns** over time.

The Portfolio Dashboard is divided into several sections:

#### **1. Header Tiles (Summary Cards)**

- **Account Balance**  
  - Displays the **available cash** in the user's account.  
  - This balance is included in profit calculations but **cannot be transferred from or to other accounts**.

- **Total Portfolio Value**  
  - Shows the **total market value of all invested assets** for the current day.  
  - **Formula:**  
    ```text
    Total Portfolio Value = Œ£(Market Value of each Stock)
    ```  
  - Market value is updated using **Yahoo Finance historical data** via `ticker.history()`.
